# Etsy Redirect

This is a simple redirecting script packaged as a Chrome extension. It *should* 
redirect you through a shop's preferred URL for a listing if it can figure one 
out.

[Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/etsy-redirect/dpgfkefefcdlffpmbcidkdhafjgdbhhh)

## Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow [instructions on developer.chrome.com](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) to load an unpacked extension.
3. Good to go! Navigate to any Etsy listing page.

## Warning

This was thrown together in an hour with basic assumptions. Assume it might not 
work and if it does, it will only last for so long.
